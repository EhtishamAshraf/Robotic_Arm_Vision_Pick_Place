# Robotic_Arm_Vision_Pick_Place
This repository contains a ROS-based solution for vision-guided pick-and-place tasks using a Universal Robots UR5 robotic arm equipped with a Robotiq 85 2-finger gripper. The project integrates computer vision with robotic manipulation to enable colour based object sorting.
